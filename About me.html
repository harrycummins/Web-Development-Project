            <h2>My History</h2>
            <p> My name is Harry Joseph Cummins. I was born in Wales on the 24th of january, in the year 2004 in a family of four and two minituare suasage dogs. I grew up in the small town of abergaveny until the age of 6 where we moved to portishead in bristol. I started my education at ticekenham primary school, before later moving to Trinity primary. These early years of education led to me becoming a student at goradno school and later a member of the sixth form at gordano. I studied Computre science, Bussines and History but my real passion was web development which i learnt in the early stages of computing. I wanted to learn further in depth about web development so i decided to apply for bath spa universitys creative computing course on the web development pathway, where i further developed my web devlopment skills aswell as other coding languages. This leads to to be about to finish first year excited to move on to the second year content to come.</p>

                    I am extremely passionate about all the subjects i have listed. My main passion is traveling the world and exploring all different types of cultures and foods which drastically vary between countrys. The countires i have visted are Turkey, Greece, Germany, France, Morroco, Spain and the Netherlands. There is so much to learn and gain experienes through travelling which cannot be achieved any other way. I love it as it allows me so much freedom to explore new locations you have never been to before and creates memorys for a lifetime. Football is also something i am extremely passionate about. I attend most of Cardiff citys football games and love the passion showed by everyone involved. The sense of community is very clear with everyone all supporting one vison and goal. I also play for my local football team which i have done for many years, which is a very close community.
